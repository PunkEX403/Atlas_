The Protogen head is a cyborg furry costume with a Raspberry Pi 4 and an RGB LED matrix inside. The Raspberry Pi controls the screen to show different facial expressions, videos, and animations, making your character look lively and fun.

This system has the LED matrix and the Raspberry Pi, which work together to control lights, movements, and effects. The software lets you change the facial expressions, animations, and effects easily.

This package gives you the main hardware and software needed to make your Protogen head work. It’s a good starting point to build your costume and bring your character to life.
